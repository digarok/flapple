Flapple Bird - A de-make of Flappy Bird for the Apple II computer

More information about this project is available at http://dagenbrock.com/flappy

How to run
==========
You can download either disk image and run it with an emulator or transfer it to the respective media and run it on a real machine (recommended).  The 3.5" ProDOS disk version is "flapple800.po", and the 5.25" ProDOS disk version is "flapple140.po".

How to build
============
This is written to compile on Merlin 8/16, but I believe should work with all later Merlin variants.  Load Merlin, then 'L'oad the file "flapple.s", finally hit OpenApple-A to assemble and it should build the "flap.system" file.
